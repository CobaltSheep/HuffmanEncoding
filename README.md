# HuffmanEncoding
Huffman Encoding project which given a file input will Huffman encode the information outputted to a given file. Done in Java, recommend using Eclipse.

**Recommend using Eclipse IDE since it is what I used, otherwise you may use IntelliJ, etc..

Run the lab by clicking the play button on your IDE, specify a file you would like to read and then specify an output file. Enjoy!
